The Charting Library works out-of-the-box but you have to set up your HTTP server to bind Library's folder to a certain domain name. For example, you may set up Apache to listen on any of your hostâ€™s free ports and refer to the folder containing the unpacked Charting Library. After you are done with it, you will have your Charting Library ready.

You may see the working example of Charting Library [here](http://demo_chart.tradingview.com). This example is based on our [sample data feed.](http://demo_feed.tradingview.com)

**IMPORTANT**: This datafeed is just a sample. It contains a dozen of symbols (from Quandl) and provides DWM only. However, it supports quotes. Please use it for testing purposes only.
